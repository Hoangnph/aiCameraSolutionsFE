## 🔧 Development Commands

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start all services
./start-dev.sh

# Stop all services
./stop-dev.sh

# Health checks
curl http://localhost:3001/health  # beAuth
curl http://localhost:3002/health  # beCamera
curl http://localhost:3000         # Frontend
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Frontend development
cd feMain && npm start

# Backend development
cd beAuth && docker-compose up -d
cd beCamera && docker-compose up -d

# Database access
docker exec -it ai-camera-postgres psql -U postgres -d people_counting_db
```

## 📊 Resource Usage

### Current Container Status
```
✅ ai-camera-postgres: Running (PostgreSQL)
✅ ai-camera-redis: Running (Redis)
✅ ai-auth-service: Running (beAuth)
✅ ai-camera-service: Running (beCamera)
✅ Frontend: Running (React)
```

### Port Allocation
- **3000**: Frontend (React)
- **3001**: beAuth Service
